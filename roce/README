TODO:
Update scripts to use ib_read_bw from
http://git.openfabrics.org/git?p=~mmarciniszyn/new_ofed/perftest/.git;a=summary

It has cool new features (e.g. run indefinitely, reporting stats every 5s).
Beware: Make sure #qpairs is always 1.  Otherwise, the utility will report
numbers that will make your NIC faster than it is.  I got 200Mpps with 64QPs
at 64Bytes.  Perfect linear scalability, even beyond what your NIC can do! :)

So, ALWAYS use the packet/byte counters from sysfs which the rocestats.py
and pps.py utilities use.

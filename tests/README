Couple of things to ensure this works in your testbed.

- Modify the two hosts parameter in netperf.py, or
  pass --hosts correctly.

- Ensure you can ssh to these hosts without a password
  and without being prompted to accept the host key

- Install pexpect, termcolor python dependencies.
  The test script uses pexpect on ssh to execute
  commands to remote machines.

- Modify parameters in host.py:
	- NETPERF_DIR should contain netserver and netperf
	  executables on all machines
	- DEFAULT_DEV is the 10GbE device for all hosts
	  you can make this host specific in get_10g_dev()
	  function in host.py
	- SHELL_PROMPT should be the last character in your
	  $PS for pexpect to work.

- Ignore newrl rate limiter.

- Install matplotlib for plotting.

To run the experiment
# ./run.sh

To plot the results
# ./plot.sh expt-output-dir
